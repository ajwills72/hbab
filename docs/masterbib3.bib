	Abstract = {Stimulus sets defined in terms of artificial polymorphous concepts have frequently been used in experiments to investigate the mechanisms of discrimination of natural concepts, both in humans and in other animals. However, such stimulus sets are frequently difficult for either animals or humans to discriminate. Properties of artificial polymorphous stimulus sets that might explain this difficulty include the complexity of the individual stimuli, the unreliable reinforcement of individual positive features, attentional load, difficulties in discriminating some stimulus dimensions, memory load, and a lack of the correlation between features that characterizes natural concepts. An experiment using chickens as subjects and complex artificial visual stimulus sets investigated these hypotheses by training the birds in discriminations that were not polymorphous but did have some of the properties listed above. Discriminations that involved unreliable reinforcement or high attentional load were found to approach the difficulty of polymorphous concept discriminations, and these two factors together were sufficient to account for the entire difficulty. The usual kind of artificial polymorphous concept may not be a good model for natural concepts as they are perceived and discriminated by birds. A RULEX account of natural concept learning may be preferable.},

	Abstract = {Several pairs of correlated features were embedded in descriptions that had a wealth of exemplar-specific (i.e., idiosyncratic) information, and sensitivity to these correlations was examined as a function of intentional and incidental encoding conditions. Participants in incidental conditions were able to access information about several embedded correlations, even when the correlations involved 3 rather than 2 dimensions, and when complex inferences were required to recover correlations. In intentional conditions, however, little access to correlations was observed. The richness of the stimuli made it difficult to detect correlations at encoding, and the representations that resulted from analysis appeared too impoverished to allow covariations to be recovered. The results are discussed in terms of the advantages of storing examples for addressing unanticipated needs and goals.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that background knowledge has a clear influence on concept learning. This influence, however, has been observed with a narrow range of intentional learning tasks. In the present experiments, the role of background knowledge was examined as a function of a variety of incidental learning tasks as well as with intentional learning tasks. The influence of prior knowledge was investigated by comparing the encoding of conceptually related co-occurrences with the encoding of conceptually unrelated co-occurrences. A clear influence of prior knowledge was observed with incidental encoding, and conceptual relatedness was found to have at least as powerful an influence with incidental as with intentional learning tasks. The results indicate that many types of knowledge-based influences will not vary as a function of encoding strategy. The pervasiveness and strength of the influence of background knowledge on concept learning are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In several experiments, observers tried to categorize stimuli constructed from two separable stimulus dimensions in the absence of any trial-by-trial feedback. In all of the experiments, the observers were told the number of categories (i.e., two), they were told that perfect accuracy was possible, and they were given extensive experience in the task (i.e., 800 trials). When the boundary separating the contrasting categories was unidimensional, the accuracy of all observers improved significantly over blocks (i.e., learning occurred), and all observers eventually responded optimally. When the optimal boundary was diagonal, none of the observers responded optimally. Instead they all used some sort of suboptimal unidimensional rule. In a separate feedback experiment, all observers responded optimally in the diagonal condition. These results contrast with those for supervised category learning; they support the hypothesis that in the absence of feedback, people are constrained to use unidimensional rules.},

Still, it is less frequent and less successful than analytic processing of separable dimensions. The studies identify several factors that influence whether or not analytic processing occurs. Among them are the following: (a) stimulus factors, in addition to the choice of dimensions (e.g., the magnitude of dimensional differences); (b) task factors (e.g., the degree to which analytic processing is encouraged by instructions or by implicit task demands, the amount of time available for processing); and (c) subject factors (e.g., the amount of experience that the perceiver has had with the stimuli in tasks that encourage stimulus analysis).},

Experiment 1 shows that similarity relations are systematically used by normal preschoolers and by retarded preadolescents for classification. Experiment 2 suggests that their tendency to use similarity relations is not merely a matter of preference, but that these children have difficulty learning to use dimensional relations. Still, experiment 3 demonstrates that dimensional relations have some psychological reality for preschoolers and for retarded children despite the dominance of overall similarity and despite the relative inaccessibility of dimensional relations. The research affords a finer specification of the development of classification skills and highlights the relation between intelligence and psychological stimulus structure.},

Subjects could classify on the basis of dimensional structure, overall similarity, or neither. Adults showed a majority of dimensionally based responses, while children gave a majority of similarity-based responses in experiment 1. This pattern is consistent with the notion of separable perception for adults and integral perception for children. The results of a pretask for experiment 2 in which subjects were required to make dimensional comparisons indicate that children's integral responding is not based on an inability to access dimensional relations. The results are discussed in terms of possible strategic differences underlying separable and integral responding.},

	Abstract = {3 experiments examined the modes of processing used by children and adults in learning family-resemblance categories. The materials were cartoon faces (Experiments 1 and 2) and bugs (Experiment 3) divided into categories that possessed no single defining attributes, but rather several characteristic attributes that were each partially predictive of category membership. The categories were structured so that a holistic mode of processing in which the individual did not selectively weight any given attributes could have led to success. Nevertheless, preschoolers (Experiments 2 and 3), first and third graders (Experiment 1), and adult college students (all experiments) all exhibited primarily analytic modes of learning that consisted of single- and dual-attribute approaches. Although the proportion of analytic learners among the preschoolers was lower than among the adults in Experiment 3, in no case were holistic modes of learning evident. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for young children's apparent relative success in learning natural categories. It is suggested that children's success in learning real-world categories may be based, in part, on an interaction between a basically analytic processing style and natural category structures that provide many partially informative attributes.},

Feature frequencies were encoded equally well across variations in learning strategies, and although classification decisions in both intentional and incidental conditions preserved correlated features, this sensitivity was achieved through different processes. With intentional learning, sensitivity to correlations resulted from explicit rules, whereas incidental encoding preserved correlations through a similarity-based analogical process. In incidental tasks that promoted exemplar storage, classification decisions were mediated by similarity to retrieved examples, and correlated features were indirectly preserved in this process. The results are discussed in terms of the diversity of encoding processes and representations that can occur with incidental category learning.},

	Abstract = {Categorization is essential for survival, and it is a widely studied cognitive adaptation in humans and animals. An influential neuroscience perspective differentiates in humans an explicit, rule-based categorization system from an implicit system that slowly associates response outputs to different regions of perceptual space. This perspective is being extended to study categorization in other vertebrate species, using category tasks that have a one-dimensional, rule-based solution or a two-dimensional, information-integration solution. Humans, macaques, and capuchin monkeys strongly dimensionalize perceptual stimuli and learn rule-based tasks more quickly. In sharp contrast, pigeons learn these two tasks equally quickly. Pigeons represent a cognitive system in which the commitment to dimensional analysis and category rules was not strongly made. Their results may reveal the character of the ancestral vertebrate categorization system from which that of primates emerged. The primate results establish continuity with human cognition, suggesting that nonhuman primates share aspects of humans' capacity for explicit cognition. The emergence of dimensional analysis and rule learning could have been an important step in primates' cognitive evolution.},

	Abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical developments in human category learning have differentiated an analytic, rule-based system of category learning from a nonanalytic system that integrates information across stimulus dimensions. In the present study, the researchers applied this theoretical distinction to pigeons' category learning. Pigeons learned to categorize stimuli varying in the tilt and width of their internal striping. The matched category problems had either a unidimensional (rule-based) or multidimensional (information-integration) solution. Whereas humans and nonhuman primates strongly dimensionalize these stimuli and learn rule-based tasks far more quickly than information-integration tasks, pigeons learned the two tasks equally quickly to the same accuracy level. Pigeons may represent a cognitive system in which the commitment to dimensional analysis and category rules was not strongly made. Their performance could suggest the character of the ancestral vertebrate categorization system from which that of primates emerged.},

@article{rescorla1979,
	Abstract = {Four experiments used an autoshaping procedure in pigeons to explore learning about the reinforcer in a second-order conditioning paradigm. Experiment 1 conditioned two visual second-order stimuli (S2), using as reinforcers two visual first-order stimuli (S1), each of which had previously been paired with food. Animals for which the S2 stimuli were each consistently paired with one particular S1 developed second-order responding more rapidly than did animals for which the identity of S1 varied from trial to trial. Moreover, following consistent pairings, extinction of an S1 had a depressive effect upon second-order responding which was peculiar to the S2 with which it had been paired. Both results suggest that in this preparation the organism identifies a particular S1 as the reinforcer for each S2. The remaining experiments examined the details of that identification. A compound S1, itself composed of two separable elements, was used to reinforce an S2. Subsequent extinction of either element of S1 led to a depression in the responding to S2, which indicates that both elements were involved in the second-order conditioning. Moreover, the use of several complex discriminations, which produced different behavior to S1 and to its elements, suggested that the organism had associated the S2 with the compound S1 rather than with its separate elements. However, even complete extinction of the response to S1 left some residual behavior to S2, which indicates that a portion of the second-order conditioning is independent of the current state of the reinforcer. These results demonstrate that in some situations the organism associates a conditioned stimulus with a rich representation of the reinforcer.},

Nonprimates, it has been argued, lack such rule transfer. We report that Rattus norvegicus can learn simple rules and apply them to new situations. Rats learned that sequences of stimuli consistent with a rule (such as XYX) were different from other sequences (such as XXY or YXX). When novel stimuli were used to construct sequences that did or did not obey the previously learned rule, rats transferred their learning. Therefore, rats, like humans, can transfer structural knowledge from sequential experiences.},

	Abstract = {Human infants and adults generate causal inferences about the physical world from observations of single, novel events, thereby violating Hume's thesis that spatiotemporal cooccurrence from prior experience drives causal perception in our species. Is this capacity unique or shared with other animals? We address this question by presenting the results of three experiments on free-ranging rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), focusing specifically on their capacity to generate expectations about the nature of completely unfamiliar physical transformations. By using an expectancy violation looking-time method, each experiment presented subjects with either physically possible or impossible transformations of objects (e.g., a knife, as opposed to a glass of water, appears to cut an apple in half). In both experiments, subjects looked longer when the transformation was impossible than when it was possible. Follow up experiments ruled out that these patterns could be explained by association. These results show that in the absence of training or direct prior experience, rhesus monkeys generate causal inferences from single, novel events, using their knowledge of the physical world to guide such expectations.},

In Experiment 1, rats were trained on a negative-patterning schedule (A+ B+ AB-) intermixed with reinforced presentations of a second compound (CD+). On a subsequent test, the rats responded more to two novel compounds, AC and BD, than to A and B, but less than to CD. In Experiment 2, rats were trained on two concurrent negative-patterning discriminations (A+ B+ AB-, C+ D+ CD-). On test, they responded more to AC and BD than to AB and CD, but less than to the single stimuli. In Experiment 3, rats were trained on two concurrent positive-patterning discriminations (A- B- AB+, C- D- CD+). On test, their response rates to AC and BD were not different from the response rates to the trained compounds (AB and CD). Finally, in Experiment 4, rats were trained on a positive- and negative-patterning discrimination concurrently. Once again, on test, response rates to AC and BD were not different from responding on reinforced trials of the trained discriminations (A+, B+, and CD+).

	Abstract = {In two experiments, human participants performed a causal judgment task that simultaneously comprised two reciprocal patterning discriminations and a biconditional discrimination. They learned both patterning discriminations more quickly than the biconditional discrimination. Postdiscrimination tests were used to identify participants who had, or had not, learned to apply the patterning rules, as well as participants who continued to expect summation when presented with two cues that predicted the same outcome. All groups were faster to learn the patterning than the biconditional discriminations. These results are inconsistent with models of stimulus representation that invoke configural representations (e.g., Pearce, 1987, 1994; Rescorla \& Wagner, 1972) because these models solve biconditional discriminations more readily than patterning discriminations.},

	Abstract = {It has recently been argued that rats engage in causal reasoning and they do so in a way that is consistent with Bayes net theories (Blaisdell, Sawa, Leising \& Waldmann, 2006). This argument was based upon the finding that the tendency of cues to elicit approach to a food-well was reduced when their presentation was contingent on lever pressing. There is, however, an alternative interpretation of the critical experimental findings that is based on the simple principle of response competition: wherein lever pressing interferes with the tendency to approach the food well. Here the authors replicated Experiments 1 and 2a of Blaisdell et al. (2006) and found reciprocal patterns of lever pressing and food well approach during the critical cues. These results lend direct support for an interpretation in terms of response competition while providing evidence contrary to Bayes net theories, and are readily interpreted within the theoretical framework provided by traditional associative learning theory.},

	Abstract = {According to configural association (CAS) theory (Sutherland \& Rudy, 1989), an intact hippocampus is required for rats to solve learning problems that are based on "configural" processes. This theory identifies the negative patterning discrimination as a critical example of this type of problem. Rudy and Sutherland (1989) reported disruption of negative patterning following hippocampal formation damage produced by intracranial infusion of a mixture of kainic acid + colchicine (KA + COL). We assessed acquisition of negative patterning in rats with hippocampal damage produced by KA + COL compared with rats with more selective ibotenate lesions of hippocampus. Neither group showed impaired negative patterning relative to controls. A transfer test provided evidence that all groups used configural processes to solve the problem. Thus contrary to CAS theory, the hippocampus is not an important substrate for the operation of configural processes.},

	Abstract = {Rats received either a common-cause (i.e., A→B, A→food) or a causal-chain training scenario (i.e., B→A, A→food) before their tendency to approach the food magazine during the presentation of B was assessed as a function of whether it was preceded by a potential alternative cause. Causal model theory predicts that the influence of an alternative cause should be restricted to the common-cause scenario. In Experiment 1, responding to B was reduced when it occurred after pressing a novel lever during the test phase. This effect was not influenced by the type of training scenario. In Experiment 2, rats were familiarized with the lever prior to test by training it as a potential cause of B. After this treatment, the lever now failed to influence test responding to B. In Experiment 3, rats given common-cause training responded more to B when it followed a cue that had previously been trained as a predictor of B, than when it followed another stimulus. This effect was not apparent in rats that received causal-chain training. This pattern of results is the opposite of that predicted by causal model theory. Thus, in three experiments, the presence of an alternative cause failed to influence test responding in manner consistent with causal model theory. These results undermine the application of causal model theory to rats, but are consistent with associative analyses.},

The claim is that animals approximate causal learning using associative processes. The present results cast doubt on that conclusion. Rats made causal inferences in a basic task that taps into core features of causal reasoning without requiring complex physical knowledge. They derived predictions of the outcomes of interventions after passive observational learning of different kinds of causal models. These competencies cannot be explained by current associative theories but are consistent with causal Bayes net theories.},

	Abstract = {Six pigeons were trained to peck at a target (odd stimulus) that was presented on a touch-screen together with three identical distractors (non-odd stimuli). The target could be either a square or a circle that was either blue or green, and the distractors in each trial were always of the opposite form and color to the target. Thus, the birds could solve the task by attending to color, form, or both. Transfer tests showed that performance was not disrupted by novel forms, stimulus sizes, distractor numbers, and display configurations, but broke down with novel stimulus types (textured stimuli, clip art images, and photographs). Transfer to novel colors was, for the most part, restricted to trials in which only one component-target or distractors, but not both-had a novel color. This suggested that the pigeons used a couple of if-then rules rather than an oddity concept to solve the task, and that color differences between target and distractors were the only cue upon which responding was based. A control experiment with the order of color and form tests being reversed excluded the possibility of the prevalence of color being an artifact of task order and reinforcement contingencies.},

	Abstract = {Investigations of patterning discriminations by nonhuman animals have generally found that positive patterning is easier to learn than negative patterning. Studies of patterning discriminations in human causal learning tasks have failed to document any differences between positive and negative patterning. In the present study, human participants predicted an outcome on trials involving either a compound cue or its elements. Positive and negative patterning problems were successfully solved in a within-subjects design; negative patterning problems proved to be more difficult when an additional, 50\% contingent cue was included (Experiment 2), but not when it was excluded (Experiment 1). Possible reasons for these results are discussed. The discussion concludes with an analysis of exemplar models (e.g., Pearce, 1994) of human causal learning and considers the conditions under which these models do and do not anticipate our results.},

	Abstract = {Two human Pavlovian SCR conditioning experiments are reported, investigating CS-coding in negative patterning (NP). In Experiment 1, NP was run with two pairs of letter stimuli (C, N, and M, J), reinforced by shock when alone but not in compound. Controls with the same paired-unpaired sequence saw two additional nonreinforced letters (X and H) instead of compounds. The NP group learned the element-compound differentiation, but the controls did not discriminate reinforced from nonreinforced letters. The availability of an abstract rule (such as stimulus number) for distinguishing between reinforced and nonreinforced CSs led to discrimination in NP, but its unavailability resulted in no discrimination in the controls. In Experiment 2, NP was run with one pair of letters (reinforced as elements but not in compound). A control group had the same paired-unpaired sequence, but their compound contained two different letters from the reinforced ones. The NP discrimination was learned, but the controls failed to differentiate the reinforced elements from the nonreinforced compound. It was concluded that the NP discrimination was not based on the number of reinforced and nonreinforced stimuli, because this dimension was available to both groups in Experiment 2. The abstract dimension of separate versus together, on the other hand, was available only in NP, suggesting that it is the SINE QUA NON for the acquisition of the kind of NP discriminations we have been studying.},

Subjects also received a positive patterning discrimination in which three additional stimuli were not followed by food when presented alone (D, E, F), or in pairs (DE, DF, EF), but they were followed by food when presented together (DEF). Stimuli A and D belonged to one dimension, B and E to a second dimension, and D and F to a third dimension. For both problems, the discrimination between the individual stimuli and the triple-element compounds developed more readily than that between the pairs of stimuli and the triple-element compound.

	Abstract = {We investigated the capability of honeybees to discriminate between single odorants, binary olfactory mixtures, and ternary olfactory mixtures in olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex. In Experiment 1, three single odorants (A+, B+, and C+) and three binary mixtures of these odors (AB+, AC+, and BC+) were reinforced while the ternary compound, consisting of all three odors (ABC-), was nonreinforced. In Experiment 2, only one single odorant (A+) and one binary olfactory compound (BC+) were reinforced while the ternary compound (ABC-) consisting of the single odor and the binary compound was nonreinforced. We studied whether bees can solve these problems and whether the course of differentiation can be predicted by the unique cue theory, a modified unique cue theory, or Pearce's configural theory. Honeybees were not able to differentiate reinforced from nonreinforced stimuli in Experiment 1. However, summation to ABC observed at the beginning of training contradicts the predictions of Pearce's configural theory. In Experiment 2, differentiation between the single odorant A and the ternary compound developed more easily than between the binary compound BC and ABC. This pattern of differentiation is in line with a modified unique cue theory and Pearce's configural theory. Summation to ABC at the beginning of training, however, again was at odds with Pearce's configural theory. Thus, olfactory compound processing in honeybees can best be explained by a modified unique cue theory.},

	Abstract = {In sequential training positive patterning hinders negative patterning, but not vice versa. This asymmetry was attributed to interference of two different rules. In a Pavlovian skin conductance response conditioning experiment with humans, we further investigated this effect. Two groups performed sequential training of positive and negative patterning with a reduced number of trials per training schedule. In Group PNP, the sequence was positive patterning (A-, B-, AB+), negative patterning (C+, D+, CD-), followed by positive patterning (E-, F-, EF+). Group NPN consisted of negative patterning (A+, B+, AB-), positive patterning (C-, D-, CD+), and negative patterning (E+, F+, EF-) again. As predicted by an attentional explanation we found no interference. Hence, the asymmetry observed earlier had been due to less attention to specific stimuli in consequence of an extensive use of the numerosity-rule.},

We used two different designs originally proposed by Redhead and Pearce (1995). In Experiments 1 and 2, three stimulus elements, A, B, and C, were presented in all possible combinations. All patterns were reinforced except for pattern ABC (A/B/C+, AB/AC/BC+, ABC-). According to elemental learning theories, response proportions on A/B/C+ trials should be smaller than on AB/AC/BC+ trials, whereas configural learning theory makes the opposite prediction. The results confirmed neither prediction. In Experiment 3, the A/B/C+, AB/AC/BC+, and ABC- trials were interspersed by D/E/F-, DE/DF/EF-, DEF+ trials. Again, neither prediction was confirmed. We suggest a modification of configural learning theory as a possible explanation of our results.},

	Abstract = {Harnessed bees conditioned to associate odors and sucrose reward learn to discriminate between olfactory mixtures and their odor components in negative (NP: A+, B+, AB-) and positive (PP: A-, B-, AB+) patterning experiments. They thus extend the proboscis to the reinforced (CS+) but not to the non-reinforced (CS-) stimuli. Using the same protocol, we studied whether or not trials, which are spaced in time, are more effective in supporting patterning discrimination than massed trials which succeed fast to each other ('trial-spacing effect'). Training followed a NP (4 A+, 4 B+, 8 AB-) or a PP (4 A-, 4 B-, 8 AB+) schedule, with a 1:1 ratio between CS+ and CS- trials (8 CS+ and 8 CS- trials). ITIs of 1, 3, 5 and 8min were used in both tasks. Increasing ITI resulted in better differentiation between reinforced and non-reinforced CSs in both NP and PP tasks. However, whereas only the longest ITI of 8min allowed discrimination in NP, PP could already be solved with an ITI of 5min. This difference might be due to the fact that NP, but not PP, would require the formation of a unique cue and thus longer processing times. We thus show that the trial-spacing effect, previously demonstrated for single stimulus conditioning, also determines performance in patterning tasks in which three different stimuli (A, B, AB) alternate so that elements have to be discriminated from their compound.},

	Abstract = {Human contingency learning was used to compare the predictions of configural and elemental theories. In three experiments, participants were required to learn which indicators were associated with an increase in core temperature of a fictitious nuclear plant. Experiments 1 and 2 investigated the rate at which a triple-element stimulus (ABC) could be discriminated from either single-element stimuli (A, B, and C) or double-element stimuli (AB, BC, and AC). Experiment 1 used visual stimuli, whilst Experiment 2 used visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli. In both experiments the participants took longer to discriminate the triple-element stimulus from the more similar double-element stimuli than from the less similar single-element stimuli. Experiment 3 tested for summation with stimuli from either a single or multiple modalities, and summation was found only in the latter case. Thus, the pattern of results seen in Experiments 1 and 2 was not dependent on whether the stimuli were single modal or multimodal, nor was it dependent on whether the stimuli could elicit summation. This pattern of results is consistent with predictions derived from Pearce's (1987, 1994) configural theory.},

All rats first received food-rewarded positive and negative patterning problems with two stimulus sets: either A+, B+, AB- and C-, D-, CD+, or A-, B-, AB + and C+, D +, and CD-. Subsequently, rats received revaluation trials in which A was paired with shock and C was not, prior to generalization test trials with B, D, AB, and CD (Experiments 1 \& 2); or received A-->shock trials prior to tests with B and CD (Experiment 3). There was greater generalized fear to B than to either D (Experiments 1 \& 2) or AB (Experiment 2) and CD (Experiments 2 \& 3). These results are inconsistent with configural, connectionist models, but are consistent with an alternative connectionist model that can represent the logical structure of XOR problems.},

One group was trained with a negative patterning schedule and a positive patterning schedule concurrently: they received intermixed trials of A+, B+, AB-, C-, D-, CD+ (A, B, C, and D are four distinct stimuli; the plus sign denotes reinforcement with food, and the minus sign denotes nonreinforcement). The second group of rats was trained with the same four stimuli arranged as compounds and reinforced according to the biconditional schedule AB+, CD+, AC-, and BD-. The first group learned the positive patterning schedule much more quickly than the negative patterning schedule, but they learned the negative patterning schedule more effectively than the second group learned the biconditional schedule.

In Experiment 1, participants were pretrained with either a configural or an elemental discrimination; in Experiment 2, they were pretrained with a configural discrimination, an elemental discrimination, or a control discrimination that was not expected to bias them toward elemental or configural processing. In both experiments, acquisition of the target configural discriminations was faster after configural pretraining than after elemental pretraining. In addition, the negative patterning discrimination was acquired faster than the biconditional discrimination. Finally, the results of Experiment 2 were more consistent with the notion that elemental pretraining hindered acquisition of the target discriminations than with the notion that configural pretraining enhanced their acquisition.

	Abstract = {Given that human causal judgments may be based on propositional reasoning processes rather than reflecting the strength of associations between cause and outcome representations (e.g., De Houwer, 2009, for a review), the question arises whether there are measures of causal learning that are sensitive only to the strength of associations. We investigated the potential of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) in this context. The results showed evidence for rule learning even when IAT effects were used as an index of learning. This suggests that the IAT does not allow one to measure causal learning in a manner that excludes an impact of conscious propositional knowledge.},

	Abstract = {The importance of configural cues and whether a situation involves beneficent or maleficent outcomes was investigated in two experiments on human causal reasoning, based on experienced causal information. Participants learned positive and negative patterning discriminations involving either beneficent or maleficent outcomes in a health-reasoning task and in a social-reasoning task. With maleficent outcomes, positive patterning was consistently easier to learn than negative patterning, a positive patterning advantage that is predicted by current associative theories and commonly taken as evidence for configural cues. However, with beneficent outcomes, the two discrimination tasks were not significantly different in ease of learning, a result not predicted by current theories. The reliable positive patterning effect found with maleficent outcomes broadens the range of conditions in which the effect can be shown in causal reasoning. The novel effect of outcome valence poses an interesting theoretical challenge for attempts to account for the relation between learning about individual cues and combinations of those cues.},

@article{livesey2011,
	Abstract = {In human causal learning, positive patterning (PP) and negative patterning (NP) discriminations are often acquired at roughly the same rate, whereas PP is learned faster than NP in most experiments with nonhuman animals. One likely reason for this discrepancy is that most causal learning scenarios encourage participants to treat the presentation and omission of the relevant outcome as two events of comparable significance and likelihood. To investigate this, the current experiments compared PP and NP using a predictive learning paradigm based on a mock gambling task. In Experiment 1, one outcome (winning) was made more salient by being less frequent than the alternative outcome (losing). Under these circumstances, PP was learned faster than NP. In Experiment 2, subjects learned two PP and two NP discriminations, one involved win versus no change outcomes, the other involved lose versus no change outcomes. The subjects learned PP faster than NP, but only when discriminating win from no change. We argue that a difference in difficulty between PP and NP relies on a difference in the salience of the outcomes, consistent with the predictions of a relatively simple model of associative learning.},

	Abstract = {Determinants of a positive patterning advantage (that is, an advantage for positive patterning over negative patterning) in human causal reasoning were examined in an experiment that compared simple patterning discriminations (A, B vs. AB) to complex patterning discriminations (AB, BC, AC vs. ABC). As predicted by a cue constellation analysis of complex discriminations, a positive patterning advantage was found with complex patterning but not with simple patterning discriminations. This result may explain why some recent studies have found a positive patterning advantage where earlier studies had failed to find one. The interaction of patterning complexity with the positive patterning advantage appears to pose problems for rule-based accounts of patterning. The results support the view that associative theories of human causal reasoning are more easily distinguished from rule-based approaches when applied to conditions that make simple rules difficult to identify or implement.},

We examined this issue in three experiments by applying different categorization tasks (gender, expressive or not, which expression and identity) to identical face stimuli. Stimuli were hybrids: they combined a man or a woman with a particular expression at a coarse spatial scale with a face of the opposite gender with a different expression at the fine spatial scale. Results suggested that the categorization task changes the spatial scales preferentially used and perceived for rapid recognition. A perceptual set effect is shown whereby the scale preference of an important categorization (e.g. identity) transfers to resolve other face categorizations (e.g. expressive or not, which expression). Together, the results suggest that categorization can be closely bound to perception.},

	Abstract = {Learning how to allocate attention properly is essential for success at many categorization tasks. Advances in our understanding of learned attention are stymied by a chicken-and-egg problem: there are no theoretical accounts of learned attention that predict patterns of eye movements, making data collection difficult to justify, and there are not enough datasets to support the development of a rich theory of learned attention. The present work addresses this by reporting five measures relating to the overt allocation of attention across 10 category learning experiments: accuracy, probability of fixating irrelevant information, number of fixations to category features, the amount of change in the allocation of attention (using a new measure called Time Proportion Shift - TIPS), and a measure of the relationship between attention change and erroneous responses. Using these measures, the data suggest that eye-movements are not substantially connected to error in most cases and that aggregate trial-by-trial attention change is generally stable across a number of changing task variables. The data presented here provide a target for computational models that aim to account for changes in overt attentional behaviors across learning.},

Japanese adults were asked to identify contrasting /r/-/l/ stimuli (e.g., "rock-lock"). An adaptive training regime starting with initially easy stimuli was contrasted with a fixed training regime using difficult stimuli, with some subjects receiving feedback on the correctness of their responses and others receiving no feedback in both conditions. After three and six sessions of training, subjects received tests assessing identification and discrimination of /r/-/l/ stimuli as well as generalization. In all cases except fixed training without feedback, subjects showed clear evidence of learning, and several indicators suggested that training affects speech perception, rather than simply auditory processes. Neuroimaging studies currently underway are examining the neural basis of these findings.},

In Experiment 1 no evidence was found for such effects when stimuli varied on 1 dimension. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated a within-category compression effect but no between category expansion effect for stimuli varying in 2 dimensions. Compression only was also shown in Experiment 4, which used pictures of actual objects. Multidimensional scaling analyses illustrate how within-category compression without expansion was sufficient to produce categorical clustering of items in the similarity space. These analyses also show that learning changed the dimensional structure of similarity space. Results are compared with those from other studies exploring similar phenomena and with neural network simulations.},

The results indicate that after a cue is blocked, subsequent learning about the cue is attenuated. This attenuated learning after blocking is obtained for both standard blocking and for backward blocking. Attenuated learning after blocking cannot be accounted for by theories such as the Rescorla-Wagner model that rely on lack of learning about a redundant cue, nor can it be accounted for by extensions of the Rescorla-Wagner model designed to address backward blocking that encode absent cues with negative values. The results are predicted by the hypothesis that people learn not to attend to the blocked cue.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that objects that are grouped together in the same category become more similar to each other and that objects that are grouped in different categories become increasingly dissimilar, as measured by similarity ratings and psychophysical discriminations. These findings are consistent with two theories of the influence of concept learning on similarity. By a Strategic Judgment Bias account, the categories associated with objects are explicitly used as cues for determining similarity, and objects that are categorized together are judged to be more similar because similarity is not only a function of the objects themselves, but also the objects' category labels. By a Changed Object Description account, category learning alters the description of the objects themselves, emphasizing properties that are relevant for categorization. A new method for distinguishing between these accounts is introduced which measures the difference between the similarity ratings of categorized objects to a neutral object. The results indicate both strategic biases based on category labels and genuine representational change, with the strategic bias affecting mostly objects belonging to different categories and the representational change affecting mostly objects belonging to the same category.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism's perceptual system that improve its ability to respond to its environment. Four mechanisms of perceptual learning are discussed: attention weighting, imprinting, differentiation, and unitization. By attention weighting, perception becomes adapted to tasks and environments by increasing the attention paid to important dimensions and features. By imprinting, receptors are developed that are specialized for stimuli or parts of stimuli. By differentiation, stimuli that were once indistinguishable become psychologically separated. By unitization, tasks that originally required detection of several parts are accomplished by detecting a single constructed unit representing a complex configuration. Research from cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, expert/novice differences, development, computer science, and cross-cultural differences is described that relates to these mechanisms. The locus, limits, and applications of perceptual learning are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {In a category-learning experiment, we assessed whether participants were able to selectively attend to different components of a compound stimulus in two distinct contexts. The participants were presented with stimulus compounds for which they had to learn categorical labels. Each compound comprised one feature from each of two dimensions, and on different trials the compound was presented in two contexts, X and Y. In Context X, Dimension A was relevant to the solution of the categorization task and Dimension B was irrelevant, whereas in Context Y, Dimension A was irrelevant and Dimension B was relevant. The results of transfer tests to novel stimuli suggested that people learned to attend selectively to Dimension A in Context X and Dimension B in Context Y. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that people can learn to selectively attend to particular dimensions of stimuli dependent on the context in which the stimuli are presented. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that context-dependent changes in attention transfer to other categorization tasks involving novel stimuli.},

Previous research by Hall, Mackintosh, Goodall,and dal Martello (1977) found that, in animals, salient cues were less likely to be blocked. Crucially, they also found that when the to-be-blocked cue was highly salient, the blocking cue would lose some control over responding. The present article extends these findings to humans and suggests that shifts in attention can explain the apparent loss of control by the previously learned cue. A connectionist model that implements attentional learning is shown to fit the main trends in the data. Model comparisons suggest that mere forgetting, implemented as weight decay, cannot explain the results.},

	Abstract = {Individuals tend to adopt either analytic or holistic modes of categorizing objects. In two studies, we examined the relation between these categorization tendencies and cognitive abilities as measured by standard psychometric instruments. The participants in both studies were pretested with a restricted classification task in which it was possible for them to classify simple stimuli by dimensional identity or overall similarity. Those making a large number of either type of categorization were then tested with subtests of the WAIS-R and with the Raven's progressive matrices. Across both studies, the analytic individuals (many dimensional identity classifications) scored higher than the holistic individuals (many overall similarity classifications) on some but not all of the subtests. The results are consistent with the idea that holistic modes of categorization may be more "primitive" than analytic modes. The findings are discussed in terms of the association between categorization mode and either general or specific cognitive abilities.},

@article{pyl1999,
	Abstract = {Although the study of visual perception has made more progress in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science, there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision, neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other areas of vision science) and defends the position that an important part of visual perception, corresponding to what some people have called early vision, is prohibited from accessing relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in determining the function it computes--in other words, it is cognitively impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and involves top-down interactions that are internal to the early vision system. Its function is to provide a structured representation of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to serve as an index into memory, with somewhat different outputs being made available to other systems such as those dealing with motor control. The paper also addresses certain conceptual and methodological issues raised by this claim, such as whether signal detection theory and event-related potentials can be used to assess cognitive penetration of vision. A distinction is made among several stages in visual processing, including, in addition to the inflexible early-vision stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation stage and a post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and inference stage, which accesses long-term memory. These two stages provide the primary ways in which cognition can affect the outcome of visual perception. The paper discusses arguments from computer vision and psychology showing that vision is "intelligent" and involves elements of "problem solving." The cases of apparently intelligent interpretation sometimes cited in support of this claim do not show cognitive penetration; rather, they show that certain natural constraints on interpretation, concerned primarily with optical and geometrical properties of the world, have been compiled into the visual system. The paper also examines a number of examples where instructions and "hints" are alleged to affect what is seen. In each case it is concluded that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the view that when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus outside early vision, in such processes as the allocation of focal attention and the identification of the stimulus.},

@article{ashby2014,
	Abstract = {There is now much evidence that humans have multiple memory systems, and evidence is also building that other cognitive processes are mediated by multiple systems. Even so, several recent articles have questioned the existence of multiple cognitive systems, and a number of these have based their arguments on results from state-trace analysis. State-trace analysis was not developed for this purpose but, rather, to identify data sets that are consistent with variation in a single parameter. All previous applications have assumed that state-trace plots in which the data fall on separate curves rule out any model in which only a single parameter varies across the two tasks under study. Unfortunately, this assumption is incorrect. Models in which only one parameter varies can generate any type of state-trace plot, as can models in which two or more parameters vary. In addition, it is straightforward to show that both single-system and multiple-systems models can generate state-trace plots that are considered in the literature to be consistent with either one or multiple cognitive systems. Thus, without additional information, there is no empirical state-trace plot that supports any inferences about the number of underlying parameters or systems.},

@article{w09,
	Abstract = {Pigeons (Columba livia), gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), and undergraduates (Homo sapiens) learned discrimination tasks involving multiple mutually redundant dimensions. First, pigeons and undergraduates learned conditional discriminations between stimuli composed of three spatially separated dimensions, after first learning to discriminate the individual elements of the stimuli. When subsequently tested with stimuli in which one of the dimensions took an anomalous value, the majority of both species categorized test stimuli by their overall similarity to training stimuli. However some individuals of both species categorized them according to a single dimension. In a second set of experiments, squirrels, pigeons, and undergraduates learned go/no-go discriminations using multiple simultaneous presentations of stimuli composed of three spatially integrated, highly salient dimensions. The tendency to categorize test stimuli including anomalous dimension values unidimensionally was higher than in the first set of experiments and did not differ significantly between species. The authors conclude that unidimensional categorization of multidimensional stimuli is not diagnostic for analytic cognitive processing, and that any differences between human's and pigeons' behavior in such tasks are not due to special features of avian visual cognition.},

The present authors replicated Kemler Nelson's human experiment and found a similar dissociation. They also extended her paradigm so as to evaluate the balance between rules and family resemblance in determining the category decisions of rhesus monkeys. Monkeys heavily favored the family resemblance strategy. Formal models showed that even after many sessions and thousands of trials, they spread attention across all stimulus dimensions rather than focus on a single, criterial dimension that could also produce perfect categorization.},

Initial reanalysis of Zeithamova and Maddox (2006, Experiment 1) revealed an apparently two-dimensional state-trace plot consistent with a dual-system interpretation of category learning. However, three modified replications of the original experiment found evidence of a single resource underlying the learning of both rule-based and information integration category structures. Follow-up analyses of the Zeithamova and Maddox data, restricted to only those participants who had learned the category task and performed the concurrent working memory task adequately, revealed a one-dimensional plot consistent with a single-resource interpretation and the results of the three new experiments. The results highlight the potential of state-trace analysis in furthering our understanding of the mechanisms underlying category learning.},

Similarly, people might gamble more in multitask situations than in single-task situations because concurrent executive processes usually interfere with each other. In the study reported here, we used a novel monetary decision-making paradigm to investigate whether multitasking could reduce rather than increase risk taking in gambling. We found that performing a task that induced cautious motor responding reduced gambling in a multitask situation (Experiment 1). We then found that a short period of inhibitory training lessened risk taking in gambling at least 2 hr later (Experiments 2 and 3). Our findings indicate that proactive motor control strongly affects monetary risk taking in gambling. The link between control systems at different cognitive levels might be exploited to develop new methods for rehabilitation of addiction and impulse-control disorders.},

	Abstract = {Learning ill-defined categories (such as the structure of Medin \& Schaffer, 1978) involves multiple learning systems and different corresponding category representations, which are difficult to detect. Application of latent Markov analysis allows detection and investigation of such multiple latent category representations in a statistically robust way, isolating low performers and quantifying shifts between latent strategies. We reanalyzed data from three experiments presented in Johansen and Palmeri (2002), which comprised prolonged training of ill-defined categories, with the aim of studying the changing interactions between underlying learning systems. Our results broadly confirm the original conclusion that, in most participants, learning involved a shift from a rule-based to an exemplar-based strategy. Separate analyses of latent strategies revealed that (a) shifts from a rule-based to an exemplar-based strategy resulted in an initial decrease of speed and an increase of accuracy; (b) exemplar-based strategies followed a power law of learning, indicating automatization once an exemplar-based strategy was used; (c) rule-based strategies changed from using pure rules to rules-plus-exceptions, which appeared as a dual processes as indicated by the accuracy and response-time profiles. Results suggest an additional pathway of learning ill-defined categories, namely involving a shift from a simple rule to a complex rule after which this complex rule is automatized as an exemplar-based strategy.},

En route to this interpretation, quantitative relationships that may exist between identification and classification performance are investigated. It is suggested that the same basic choice processes may operate in the two paradigms but that the similarity parameters that determine performance change systematically according to the structure of the choice paradigm. In particular, when subjects are able to attend selectively to the component dimensions that compose the stimuli, the similarity parameters may tend toward what is optimal for maximizing performance.},

	Abstract = {Preschool children and adults were compared in two experiments examining the basic issue of whether perceptual representations of objects are built-up from independent features along the dimensions of size and brightness. Experiment 1 was a visual search experiment. Subjects searched for targets which differed from distractors either by a single feature or by a conjunction of features. Results from preschoolers were comparable to those from adults, and were consistent with Treisman and Gelade's (1980, Cognitive Psychology, 12, 97-136) feature-integration theory of attention. Their theory states that independent features are encoded in parallel and are later combined with a spatial attention mechanism. However, children's significantly steeper conjunctive search slope indicated a slower speed of feature integration. In Experiment 2, four mathematical models of pattern recognition were tested against classification task data. The findings from both age groups were again consistent with a model assuming that size and brightness features are initially registered, and then integrated. Moreover, the data from Experiment 2 imply that perceptual growth entails small changes in the discriminability of featural representations; however, both experiments show that the operations performed on these representations are the same developmentally.},

The crucial aspect that is tested is whether or not familiarity of a stimulus affects response time in categorization. We show that, for our design, DBT, extended with some reasonable and testable assumptions, predicts no familiarity effect. Our prediction is nonparametric in that, rather than fit a specific instantiation of general DBT, we posit only some general assumptions of this theory and derive the prediction from these assumptions. It is found that familiarity did have a strong impact on response time for at least half of our participants. We suggest that DBT is in itself incomplete and should be extended to account for the full range of available data.},

   We discuss a ``network inhibition hypothesis{''} in which focal temporal

	Abstract = {{Why do complex-partial seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) cause a
   loss of consciousness? Abnormal function of the medial temporal lobe is
   expected to cause memory loss, but it is unclear why profoundly impaired
   consciousness is so common in temporal lobe seizures. Recent exciting
   advances in behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging
   techniques spanning both human patients and animal models may allow new
   insights into this old question. While behavioral automatisms are often
   associated with diminished consciousness during temporal lobe seizures,
   impaired consciousness without ictal motor activity has also been
   described. Some have argued that electrographic lateralization of
   seizure activity to the left temporal lobe is most likely to cause
   impaired consciousness, but the evidence remains equivocal. Other data
   correlates ictal consciousness in TLE with bilateral temporal lobe
   involvement of seizure spiking. Nevertheless, it remains unclear why
   bilateral temporal seizures should impair responsiveness. Recent
   evidence has shown that impaired consciousness during temporal lobe
   seizures is correlated with large-amplitude slow EEG activity and
   neuroimaging signal decreases in the frontal and parietal association
   cortices. This abnormal decreased function in the neocortex contrasts
   with fast polyspike activity and elevated cerebral blood flow in limbic
   and other subcortical structures ictally. Our laboratory has thus
   proposed the ``network inhibition hypothesis,{''} in which seizure
   activity propagates to subcortical regions necessary for cortical
   activation, allowing the cortex to descend into an inhibited state of
   unconsciousness during complex-partial temporal lobe seizures.
   Supporting this hypothesis, recent rat studies during partial limbic
   seizures have shown that behavioral arrest is associated with frontal
   cortical slow waves, decreased neuronal firing, and hypometabolism.
   Animal studies further demonstrate that cortical deactivation and
   behavioral changes depend on seizure spread to subcortical structures
   including the lateral septum. Understanding the contributions of network
   inhibition to impaired consciousness in TLE is an important goal, as
   recurrent limbic seizures often result in cortical dysfunction during
   and between epileptic events that adversely affects patients' quality of
   life.}},

	Abstract = {{Is human Pavlovian conditioning driven by a unitary, propositional
   system (as claimed by Mitchell, De Houwer, \& Lovibond, 2009) or by dual
   systems; one under conscious control, symbolic in nature, and requiring
   effort to deploy, and the other utilizing associative processes and
   automatic in its operation (McLaren, Green, \& Mackintosh, 1994)? Past
   research has suggested that for electrodermal conditioning to occur in
   humans, conscious awareness of the contingencies is necessary to produce
   conditioned responding (e.g., Hinchy, Lovibond, \& Ter-Horst, 1995), as
   predicted by single process theories that attribute the conditioned
   response (CR) to conscious expectancy of the shock. In this article, the
   authors examined the Perruchet effect (Perruchet, 1985), using an
   electrodermal paradigm to determine whether there is any role for
   associative processes in human electrodermal conditioning. The authors
   attempted to replicate the basic effect, whereby expectancy of an
   unconditioned stimulus (US) increases over a run of nonreinforced trials
   while the CR to the conditional stimulus (CS) declines, and the
   complementary pattern in which expectancy decreases over a run of
   reinforced trials while the CR to the CS grows in strength. In line with
   these patterns, the change in skin conductance response (our CR) as a
   function of US run length was found to follow a linear trend opposite to
   that of conscious expectancy of shock with respect to US run length.
   This dissociation supports a dual-processing system account of human
   Pavlovian conditioning, with conscious, controlled processes governing
   expectancy (and subject to the gambler's fallacy), whereas automatic,
   associative processes determine at least some of the strength of the CR
   to the CS.}},

	Abstract = {{Squire and colleagues have proposed that trace and delay eyeblink
   conditioning are fundamentally different kinds of learning: trace
   conditioning requires acquisition of a conscious declarative memory for
   the stimulus contingencies whereas delay conditioning does not.
   Declarative memory in trace conditioning is thought to generate
   conditioned responding through the activation of a conscious expectancy
   for when the unconditioned stimulus (US) is going to occur. Perruchet
   (1985) has previously shown that in a 50\% partial reinforcement design
   it is possible to dissociate single cue delay eyeblink conditioning from
   conscious expectancy for the US by examining performance over runs of
   reinforced and nonreinforced trials. Clark, Manns, and Squire (2001)
   claim that this dissociation does not occur in trace eyeblink
   conditioning. In the present experiment we examined the Perruchet effect
   for short, moderate, and long trace intervals (600, 1000, and 1400 ms)
   and for the equivalent interstimulus intervals (ISIs) in a delay
   conditioning procedure. We found evidence for a dissociation of eyeblink
   CRs and US expectancy over runs regardless of whether there was a delay
   or a trace arrangement of cues. The reasons for the Perruchet effect are
   still unclear, but the present data suggest that it does not depend on a
   separate nondeclarative system of the type proposed by Squire and
   colleagues.}},

   dissociation between trends in the conscious expectancy of an event and
   the speed of a response that is cued by that event. They argued that
   this indicates the operation of independent processes in human
   associative learning. However, there remains a strong possibility that
   this dissociation is not a consequence of associative learning and is
   instead caused by changes in vigilance or sensitivity based on the
   recency of events on previous trials. Three experiments tested this
   possibility with versions of a cued reaction time task in which trends
   in performance could not be explained by these nonassociative factors.
   Experiment I introduced a dual-response version of the task, in which
   response-related vigilance should be held relatively constant, and
   Experiments 2 and 3 used a differential conditioning procedure to
   separate the influence of recent response cue presentation from the
   recent associative history of the trial events. In all experiments,
   similar trends in reaction time were evident, suggesting a genuine
   influence of associative learning on response performance. Experiment 3
   demonstrated that the associative contribution to these trends was not
   caused by commensurate changes in expectancy of the response cue.}},

   are faster to respond to the square following many recent tone-square

   Of importance, expectancy of the square is highest when performance on

   suggests that RT performance is determined by the strength of a
   tone-square link and that this link is the product of a

@article{dest10,
	Abstract = {{In a previous study, we reported a dissociation between subjective
   expectancy and motor behaviour in a simple associative learning task
   (Perruchet, Cleeremans, Destrebecqz, 2006). According to previous
   conditioning studies (Clark, Manns, Squire, 2001), this dissociation is
   observed when the to-be-associated events coterminate and thus overlap
   in time (a training regimen called delay conditioning), but not when
   they are separated by a temporal delay (trace conditioning). In this
   latter situation indeed, there tends to be a direct relationship between
   subjective expectancy and behaviour. In this study, we further
   investigated this issue in a series of experiments where conscious and
   unconscious components of performance were pitted against each other. In
   Experiments 1-3, participants performed a simple reaction time task in
   which a preparatory signal (a tone) either overlapped with or terminated
   earlier than the imperative stimulus (a visual target presented in 50\%
   of the trials). After each response, participants also had to state how
   much they expected the imperative stimulus to be displayed on the next
   trial. Results indicate that reaction times tend to decrease when the
   tone is consistently followed by the visual target across successive
   trials, whereas conscious expectancy for the target decreases at the
   same time. Importantly, we systematically found that the temporal
   relationship between the tone and the target failed to influence
   performance. In a fourth experiment, we examined whether these results
   extend to a two-choice reaction time task. To our surprise, we observed

	Abstract = {{P. Perruchet (1985b) showed a double dissociation of conditioned
   responses (CRs) and expectancy for an airpuff unconditioned stimulus
   (US) in a 50\% partial reinforcement schedule in human eyeblink
   conditioning. In the Perruchet effect, participants show an increase in
   CRs and a concurrent decrease in expectancy for the airpuff across runs
   of reinforced trials; conversely, participants show a decrease in CRs
   and a concurrent. increase in expectancy for the airpuff across runs of
   nonreinforced trials. Three eyeblink conditioning experiments
   investigated whether the linear trend in eyeblink CRs in the Perruchet
   effect is a result of changes in associative strength of the conditioned
   stimulus (CS), US sensitization, or learning the precise timing of the
   US. Experiments I and 2 demonstrated that the linear trend in eyeblink
   CRs is not the result of US sensitization. Experiment 3 showed that the
   linear trend in eyeblink CRs is present with both a fixed and a variable
   CS-US interval and so is not the result of learning the precise timing

	Abstract = {{Whereas previous evaluative conditioning (EC) studies produced
   inconsistent results concerning the role of contingency knowledge, there
   are classical eye-blink conditioning studies suggesting that declarative
   processes are involved in trace conditioning but not in delay
   conditioning. In two EC experiments pairing neutral sounds (conditioned
   stimuli; CSs) with affective pictures (unconditioned stimuli; USs), we
   tested whether the type of conditioning procedure affects the
   relationship between awareness and EC. Auditory CSs and visual USs were
   either overlapping and co-terminating (Delay Conditioning Group), or
   they were separated by a short temporal gap (Trace Conditioning Group).
   In both groups, contingency awareness was manipulated by varying the
   duration at which the US was presented during conditioning. Furthermore,
   in addition to a post-conditioning measure of awareness, US
   detectability was measured concurrently during the learning phase in
   Experiment 2. US exposure duration affected both measures of awareness.
   The data of both experiments demonstrate that EC does not occur if the
   USs are presented at very brief durations, but reliable EC effects can
   be observed at longer US exposure durations. As there were no
   differences between trace and delay conditioning, the data suggest that
   contingency awareness plays a crucial role in trace and in delay
   conditioning of evaluative responses. These results challenge automatic
   association-formation accounts of EC, but they are in line with
   `single-process' accounts assuming EC to be dependent on conscious
   declarative knowledge about CS US contingencies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

   But reinforcement learning, as a theoretical framework, can apply at two

   Reinforcement learning is often viewed in mechanistic terms - as
   describing the operation of aspects of an agent's cognitive and neural
   machinery. Yet it can also be viewed as a rational level of description,
   specifically, as describing a class of methods for learning from
   experience, using minimal background knowledge. This paper considers how
   rational and mechanistic perspectives differ, and what types of evidence
   distinguish between them. Reinforcement learning research in the
   cognitive and brain sciences is often implicitly committed to the
   mechanistic interpretation. Here the opposite view is put forward: that
   accounts of reinforcement learning should apply at the rational level,
   unless there is strong evidence for a mechanistic interpretation.

	Abstract = {{Time plays a central role in consciousness. A crucial question is the
   following: Why Consciousness takes time? We suggest the contents of
   consciousness could emerge as the result of global competition biased by
   top-down (intentional) modulation, which implements global constraint
   satisfaction. In our simplified conceptual framework, the information
   integration and the consciousness are not implemented by separate
   processes but are unified through the idea that a network arrives at an
   interpretation of the input by converging towards a dynamical state,
   i.e. a recurring pattern related to the existence of a stable travelling
   wave. The synfire propagation can be recasted in this framework as a
   particular instance of conscious computation where (i) the network has a
   specialized topology (a chain of connected pools) and (ii) the sequence
   of spikes converge towards a synchronous spike volley. The framework we
   suggest has interesting connections with the neural processing proposed
   by Hopfield (1982) where the computation is achieved through the
   convergence of the dynamical system describing the neural network
   towards a fixed point. Here the attractors are correlated activities (or
   spatiotemporal periodic travelling waves) and the idea of associative
   memory can be generalized in this context.}},
